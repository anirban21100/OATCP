Define a custom comparison function compare that takes two integers and returns true if their concatenation results in a larger number when a is placed before b, otherwise false.
Sort the array of integers using the custom comparison function.
Concatenate the sorted integers to form the result string.
If the first character of the result string is '0', return "0" (since the largest number cannot start with '0').
Otherwise, return the result string.
