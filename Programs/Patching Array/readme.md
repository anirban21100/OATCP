1. **Function:** `minPatches(nums, n)`
2. **Inputs:**
   - `nums`: A sorted array of positive integers.
   - `n`: The target sum.
3. **Output:** Returns the minimum number of patches required to make the sum of elements in the array greater than or equal to `n`.
4. **Algorithm:**

   - Initialize `maxreach` to 0 (current maximum reachable sum).
   - Initialize `ans` to 0 (number of patches added).
   - Iterate over the elements in `nums`:
     - If the current element in `nums` is greater than `(maxreach + 1)` (indicating a gap in the reachable sum), add patches until the gap is filled.
     - Update `maxreach` to include the current element.
     - If `maxreach` is greater than or equal to `n`, return `ans`.
   - If `maxreach` is still less than `n`, add patches until `maxreach` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - Return `ans`.

5. **Function:** `main()`
6. **Algorithm:**
   - Read a line containing space-separated integers into string `s`.
   - Parse the integers from `s` and store them in vector `nums`.
   - Read integer `n`.
   - Call `minPatches(nums, n)` and store the result in `res`.
   - Print `res`.
